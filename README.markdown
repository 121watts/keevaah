Welcome to Keevaah!
==

See the site live at [kevah.herokuapp.com](http://kevah.herokuapp.com)

Keevaah is a mock crowd-sourced micro-lending site. The purpose of the project was to experiment with multitenancy, authorization/authentication, and using legacy code.  We started with an [online marketplace](ivorytowerdonuts.herokuapp.com) and turned it into a site inspired by [Kiva.org](www.kiva.org).


The site is broken into two experiences the LENDER and BORROWER.  A lender contributes money to particluar loan requests and a borrower asks for all the monies.  

To login as a lender sign in with:

*  username: lender@keevaah.com
*  password: password

If you choose the lender path make sure to complete a checkout process (don't worry, you don't need to put in real credit card info).  

To login as a borrower sign in with:

*  username: borrower@keevaah.com
*  password: password

### Enjoy lending fake money to fake people!
